            Gilbert always had a love for entrepreneurship and cars, so what better way to make a living than open a mechanic shop?
            He first opened his shop in Pacific Beach and has been in the business for over two decades.
            It was in 2016 when he decided to relocate Gil's Automotive to Escondido.
            He spent a lot of hours in and out of the garage to develop a business that provides high quality services at an affordable price.
            We're happy to serve the Escondido community and hope to see you come.
